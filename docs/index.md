<p> <h2 align="center">Why? ü§®</h2> </p>

Chirps are by far the most thoroughly researched communication signal of electric, probably even all fish. But detecting chirps becomes hard when more than one fish is recorded. As a result, most of the research to date analyzes this signal in isolated individuals. This is **not** good.

To tackle this isse, this package provides a simple toolbox to detect chirps of multiple fish on spectrograms. This enables true quantitative analyses of chirping between freely behaving fish for the first time.
