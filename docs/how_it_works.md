Chirps manifest as excursions in the electric organ discharge **frequency**. To discern the individual chirps in a recording featuring multiple fish separated solely by frequency, we delve into the **frequency domain**. This involves the computation of spectrograms, ensuring ample temporal resolution for chirp distinction and sufficient frequency resolution for fish differentiation. The outcome is a series of **images**.

This framework facilitates the application of potent **computer vision algorithms**, such as a <i>faster-R-CNN</i>, for the detection of objects like chirps within these 'images.' Each chirp detection yields a bounding box, a motif echoed in the package's logo.

Post-processing steps refine the results, assigning chirp times to the fundamental frequencies of each fish captured in the recording.
