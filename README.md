## The Problem

Chirps are by far the most thoroughly studied communication signal of weakly electric, probably even all fish. But detecting chirps becomes so hard when more than one fish is recorded. As a result, most of the research to date analyzes this signal in isolated individuals. This is **not** good.

## The Solution

To tackle this isse, this package provides a simple tool to detect chirps of multiple fish on spectrogram images. This enables true quantitative analyses of chirping between freely interacting fish for the first time.
