# chirpdetector 
... detects brief communication signals of weakly electric fish.

## Todo

- [ ] Move the dataconverter from `gridtools` to `chirpdetector`
- [ ] Extend the dataconverter to just output the spectrograms so that hand-labelling can be done in a separate step
- [ ] Add a main script so that the cli is `chirpdetector <task> --<flag> <args>`
- [ ] Improve simulation of chirps to include more realistic noise, undershoot and maybe even phasic-tonic evolution of the frequency of the big chirps
- [ ] make the `copyconfig` script more
- [ ] start writing the chirp assignment algorithm
