**This project is still work in progress and will approximately be released in
spring of 2024.**

## The Problem

Chirps are by far the most thoroughly studied communication signal of weakly
electric, probably even all fish. But detecting chirps becomes so hard when
more than one fish is recorded. As a result, most of the research to date
analyzes this signal in isolated individuals. This is **not** good.

## The Solution

To tackle this isse, this package provides a simple tool to detect chirps of
multiple fish. Todo so, it uses GPU-accelerated spectrogram computation and
deep neural networks to detect chirps in the spectrogram. The package is
designed to be easy to use and to be integrated into existing data analysis
pipelines. Have fun detecting chirps!
