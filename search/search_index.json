But as soon as the electric fields of more than one fish is recorded on the same electrode, detecting chirps becomes so hard, that most of the research to date analyzes this signal in isolated individuals. This is not particularly advantageous if the focus lies on the communication aspect of this signal. </p>"},{"location":"#the-solution","title":"The Solution","text":"<p>To tackle this isse, this package provides an interface to detect chirps of multiple fish on spectrogram images.
